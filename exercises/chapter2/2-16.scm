;;; Although algebraically equivalent, the occurence of uncertain number's
;;; operation is different, which means different process of accumulation of
;;; percentage, and it will result into answers with different error bounds

;;; it seems POSSIBILE, if we can delay actual uncertain compuation to the final
;;; and necessary stage, by applying algebraic simplification first and as much as possibile
